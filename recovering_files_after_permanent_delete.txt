Once you have done permanent delete, i.e., rm -rf command then the following recovery procedure can be used for recovery
The following command works best for cpp files. You can run this command on the same machine where the files got deleted.

// First install the foremost software
sudo apt install foremost

// Run this command to recoved permanently deleted files
sudo foremost -v -t cpp -i /dev/nvme0n1p5 -o /home/ubuntu/Downloads/recover -T

/dev/nvme0n1p5 --> this is the input file, the location where the files got deleted
/home/ubuntu/Downloads/recover --> this the location where you want to save the recovered files

// The recovered files will require permission
sudo chmod -R 777 /home/hitech/Downloads/recover3_Sat_Oct__5_19_53_33_2024/

// Search for keywords in the recovered files
grep -r --include="*.cpp" "example" /home/ubuntu/Downloads/recover_Sat_Oct__5_14_09_11_2024/
